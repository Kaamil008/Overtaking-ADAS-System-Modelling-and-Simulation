# Overtaking-ADAS-System-Modelling-and-Simulation
Overtaking taking accounts for the majority of accidents in a population dense country, and is one of the toughest and most dangerous maneuvers among other manuevers while driving a vehicle. Developing overtaking assistance system helps the driver overtake smoothly and safely without collision. In order to develop overtaking ADAS systems, an efficient controller is required; which is developed with various scenarios in this course for safe maneuver.

In this project, a basic controller logic is used to achieve the target.
